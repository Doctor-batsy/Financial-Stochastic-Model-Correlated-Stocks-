In this work, I tackled the challenge of solving complex high-dimensional partial differential equations by using Deep Neural Networks. This innovative approach helped avoid the typical difficulties associated with such equations, known as the curse of dimensionality. I achieved this by redefining the equations as problems that could handle an infinite number of variables in a stochastic optimization framework. For more insights, detailed explanations, and practical examples, you can refer to the PDF extracted from my original paper, which provides an accessible and thorough overview of the methodologies and applications explored in my work.
